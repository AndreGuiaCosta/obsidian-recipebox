# Run this from the development branch when ready to publish a stable release.
#
# Usage:
#   npm run release:stable          # merge to main, tag, publish
#   npm run release:stable -- --rc  # merge to release-candidate only, no tag
#
# Example (no --rc):
#   development is at 0.1.7-beta.3
#   running this script:
#     1. bumps development to 0.1.7
#     2. merges development -> main
#     3. tags 0.1.7 on main
#     4. returns to development (already in sync, no extra commit on main)
